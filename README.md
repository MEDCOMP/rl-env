# rl-env

This repository contains files to train and evaluate an agent on `gym-minigrid` environment. 

TO-DO: add an image for minigrid environment

In the given example code, the agent is trained using feUdal Network. These files can be easily modified to add different RL algorithms.


### Files 

What are all the files and what they do? 


### Example of use 

commands to start the docker container and run the scripts.

### Add new algorithms
