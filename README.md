# rl-env

This repository contains files to train and evaluate an agent on `gym-minigrid` environment. 

TO-DO: add an image for minigrid environment

In the given example code, the agent is trained using feUdal Network. These files can be easily modified to add different RL algorithms.


### Files and Folders 

`/train.py`: script to train agent. 

`/evaluate.py`: script to evaluate model.

After training or evaluation the output gets saved in the `Results/` folder.

`/algos.py`: contains feUdal Network implementation. 

`model/`: contains code to define neural network architectures required for algorithm implementation.

`envs/`: contains code required to customize the environment.  
 
### Example of use 

commands to start the docker container and run the scripts.

### Add new algorithms

Instructions on how to add new algorithms and train the agent.
