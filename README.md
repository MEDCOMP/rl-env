# rl-env

This repository contains files to train and evaluate an agent on `gym-minigrid` environment. 

TO-DO: add an image for minigrid environment

In the given example code, the agent is trained using feUdal Network. These files can be easily modified to add different RL algorithms.


### Files 
What are all the files and what they do? 

- **train.py**, script to train agent including:
  - Save model
  - Save rewards in NumPy format 
  - Stop and restart training
- **evaluate.py**, script to evaluate model including:
  - Act by sampling or argmax
  - Save rewards in NumPy format
- **model.py**, code to define network architectures including:
- **algos.py**, including:
  - feUdal Network algorithm implementation
  - functions for returning next action and 
 


### Example of use 

commands to start the docker container and run the scripts.

### Add new algorithms

Instructions on how to add new algorithms and train the agent.
